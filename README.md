# Robust Control of MIMO Mechatronic Systems

## This class:
- Introduces the concept of H-infinity control design for LTI systems
- Defines and analyzes plant, controller, input, and stead-state sensitivity functions
- Introduces Linear Matrix Inequalities and Linear Parameter Varying systems as mechanisms for robust control of non-linear systems
